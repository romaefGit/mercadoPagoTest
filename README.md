This web app show one view with a searchbox in the top and behind the list of products, also this have another view to manage the detail. 

This works with hooks, pages, fetching, containers, components and styles with `SASS` and also `styled-component`, the icons are from react and the grids work with `flex CSS`.

The BackEnd is with `NODEJS`,`EXPRESS`,`SEQUELIZE` and for the DATABASE use `MySql`, The sequelize works with other dialects of database, so this is scalable.

The sequelize permit make all the structure of teh database with relations between tables and then, syncronyze that with a database created before.
